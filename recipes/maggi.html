      Maggi instant noodles are popular in Bangladesh, South Africa, Pakistan,
      Singapore, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka,
      Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives and India and are synonymous with instant noodles
      in most of these countries. Nestle has a 39% market share in Malaysia, and
      had 90% market share in India prior to a nationwide ban by the Food Safety
      and Standards Authority of India. The ban was later lifted, but market
      share diminished to 53%. In Malaysia and Singapore, fried noodles made
      from Maggi noodles are called Maggi goreng. Maggi Instant noodles are
      branded as "Maggi 2 Minute Noodles" in Australia, South Africa, New
      Zealand and India.

      In India, Maggi Masala noodles carry a green dot, meaning they are
      specifically formulated to serve vegetarians. However, Maggi chicken
      noodles carry a red triangle, indicating that they are not vegetarian.
      This special formulation is not available in other countries, unless
      imported from India.

            If you prefer, leave out the Tastemaker flavor packet and use your

            bouillon, or cajun seasoning.
          </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Simmer the Maggi for 2 minutes</b>. Turn the burner down to medium or
        medium-high so the water bubbles gently. Stir the noodles occasionally
        to help them break up. They should be fully cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Whisk 1 egg in a small bowl and add it to the pot with noodles.</b>
        Crack the egg into a small bowl and use a fork or whisk to beat it until
        it's foamy. Then stir the egg into the pot with the cooked noodles.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you like less liquid in your bowl of noodles, drain the noodles
            and return them to the pot. Then stir the egg into them.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cook the egg with the noodles for about 2 minutes.</b> Turn the
        burner to medium heat and stir the noodles as the egg cooks. Keep
        stirring until the egg is completely cooked and scrambled into the
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Stir in cheese and serve the Maggi noodles.</b> Turn off the burner
        and add 1/2 cup (50 g) of grated cheese. Stir the noodles and taste
        them. Then add salt and pepper as you like. Serve the noodles while
        they're still hot for the best flavor.
